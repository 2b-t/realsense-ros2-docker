## 0. Overview
This repository contains a Docker and all the documentation required to launch an [Intel Realsense camera](https://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-overview.html) with the [Robot Operating System ROS 2](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html).

## 1. Creating a Docker
There are two different approaches for creating a Docker for a Realsense camera, one uses existing **Debian packages** while the other performs a full **compilation from source**. It is then important to mount `/dev` as a volume so that the Docker can access the hardware.

In the `docker-compose.yml` this is done with the options:

```yaml
    volumes:
      - /dev:/dev
    device_cgroup_rules:
      - 'c 81:* rmw'
      - 'c 189:* rmw'
```

For more information on how to obtain these device cgroup rules see [here](https://github.com/2b-t/docker-for-robotics/blob/main/doc/WorkingWithHardware.md). For running the IMU as well you will have to add [**`privileged: true`**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#domainname-hostname-ipc-mac_address-privileged-read_only-shm_size-stdin_open-tty-user-working_dir).

### 1.1 Installation from Debian packages

The relevant packages for `amd64` and most distributions can be installed from Debian packages. This is significantly simpler and less error prone than a full compilation from source but corresponding Debian packages might not be available for all Ubuntu versions and are sadly currently not available for `arm64`. **In the case of an `arm64` architecture you will have to go for a compilation from source as described in the next section.** The corresponding Dockerfile for `amd64` can be found below. It is based on the installation guides for [`librealsense`](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/doc/distribution_linux.md#installing-the-packages) and [its ROS wrapper](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros/tree/ros2-beta).

```Dockerfile
FROM ros:humble-perception

ENV WS_DIR="/ros2_ws"
WORKDIR ${WS_DIR}

SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-c"]

ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

RUN apt-get update \
 && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    cmake \
    git-all \
    software-properties-common \
 && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN apt-get update \
 && apt-get install -y \
    ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-librealsense2* \
    ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-realsense2-* \
 && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN apt-get update \
 && apt-get install -y \
    ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-rviz2 \
 && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=dialog
```

### 1.2 Installation from source
The installation from source is slightly more involved but more general. It might work with ROS 2 distributions before the support is officially added (as used to be the case for ROS Humble for quite a while) as well as with **architectures for which no Debian packages are available such as `arm64`** (e.g. the Nvidia Jetson family, see [issue #1](https://github.com/2b-t/realsense-ros2-docker/issues/1#)). In order to optimise memory usage a [multi-stage build](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) is performed. The Dockerfile is inspired by the [Dockerfile of `librealsense`](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/scripts/Docker/Dockerfile) contributed by community members:

```

## 2. Launching
Allow the container to display contents on your host machine by typing

```bash
$ xhost +local:root
```

Then build the Docker container with

```shell
$ docker compose -f docker-compose-gui.yml build
```
or directly with the [`devcontainer` in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). For Nvidia graphic cards the file `docker-compose-gui-nvidia.yml` in combination with the [`nvidia-container-runtime`](https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-container-runtime/) has to be used instead.
After it is done building **connect the Realsense**, start the container

```shell
$ docker compose -f docker-compose-gui.yml up
```
and see if you can **detect it from inside the Docker** by typing inside the Docker
```shell
$ rs-enumerate-devices --compact
```
Then continue to launch the proprietary visualisation applet
```shell
$ realsense-viewer
```
Turn on the camera inside the application, see if you can see a three-dimensional image. Finally we can **launch the ROS 2 wrapper**
```shell
$ ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_launch.py pointcloud.enable:=true
```
and in another terminal the ROS visualiser Rviz
```shell
$ ros2 run rviz2 rviz2
```
In Rviz you can then display the topics published by the Realsense. For the list of available topics use
```shell
$ ros2 topic list
```
in combination with
```shell
$ ros2 topic info <topic_name>
```
to find out what display type has to be selected in Rviz.

## 3. Debugging

- The Intel Realsense driver has several serious flaws/bugs. Probably the main one is that it is **closely connected to the [kernel version of the Linux operating system](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/9360)**. If the Dockerfile above do not work then you are likely unlucky and it is an incompatible version of the kernel of your host system and you will either have to [downgrade your kernel](https://linuxhint.com/install-linux-kernel-ubuntu/) or switch to another Ubuntu version that is officially supported. Furthermore from time to time the software will give you cryptic error messages. For some restarting the corresponding software component might help, for others you will find a fix googling and with others you will have to learn to live.

- The Realsense is **pretty [picky about USB 3.x cables](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/2045)**. If your camera is detected via `rs-enumerate-devices`, you can see it `realsense-viewer` but can't output its video stream, then it might be that your cable lacks the bandwidth. Either you can try to turn down the resolution of the camera in the `realsense-viewer` or switch cable (preferably to one that is [already known to work](https://community.intel.com/t5/Items-with-no-label/long-USB-cable-for-realsense-D435i/m-p/694963)).

- In case you want to also use the **IMU** present in some Realsense models such as the D435i with e.g.
  ```
  $ ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_launch.py pointcloud.enable:=true enable_gyro:=true enable_accel:=true unite_imu_method:=2
  ```

  it seems like the only way for this is to run the container with the [**`privileged`** flag](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#domainname-hostname-ipc-mac_address-privileged-read_only-shm_size-stdin_open-tty-user-working_dir). For more details see [issue #5](https://github.com/2b-t/realsense-ros2-docker/issues/5).
